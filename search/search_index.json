See the Physical Puzzle page on the Superliminal wiki and Rowan Fortier's video about the history of physical hypercubes.</p>   How do I get Melinda's Physical 2x2x2x2? <p>All the information can be found on the Superliminal website, including the history, statistics, and Hall of Fame.</p>   Can I purchase any of Grant's hypercuboids? <p>No. Currently, they are one-of-a-kind. You would have to design and 3D print them yourself.</p>   What physical 4D puzzles exist? <p>2x2x2x2, 2x2x2x3, 2x2x3x3, 2x3x3x3, and 3x3x3x3</p>   Which 4D shapes can be turned into physical puzzles? <p>While it's always possible to just arrange the stickers on a table, the real challenge is in finding a design that is piece-based instead of sticker-based and fits in a compact shape that isn't too horrendous to turn. It just requires out-of-the-box thinking. We currently have several renderings for physical puzzles that haven't been built in real life yet.</p>   Can a physical 5D puzzle exist? <p>In 3d space, it's difficult to find a symmetrical design to arrange 5 colors. It's possible using icosahedral symmetry (https://math.stackexchange.com/q/103005/1115019), but it would be painful to use. Perhaps some clever design will be invented in the future that allows us to fully implement 5D+ puzzles.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#virtual-puzzles","title":"Virtual puzzles","text":"What program should I download? <p>It depends on what exactly you want to do. If you just want to solve the 3^4, then Hyperspeedcube is the way to go. If you want to explore other puzzles or dimensions, then MC4D, MPU, MC5D, MC7D is next. For Android phones and tablets, you can download MC4D from the Google Play store. If you want to go even further down the rabbit hole, there's MagicTile, M120C, Nan Ma's 11-cell, Magic Simplex 5d, MC3D.</p>   How do I start learning to solve 4D puzzles? <p>First, download Hyperspeedcube or MC4D and start experimenting with the 3^4! Try to solve one-move scrambles and keep practicing that until you're comfortable. Once you can solve one-move scrambles with ease, pick a method to learn.</p>   What methods exist for the 3^4? <p>Many 3D methods can just be scaled up and used on the 4D cube. Some notable methods are:</p> <ul> <li>Layer-by-layer</li> <li>Sheerin-Zhao Hybrid v2 \u2014 4D CFOP</li> <li>3Block \u2014 4D FreeFOP, ~20% fewer moves compared to CFOP</li> <li>Octachoroux \u2014 4D Roux, but awkward to use and many parity issues</li> </ul> <p>Alterantively, join others in voice chat on the Hypercubers Discord Server and someone will teach you!</p>   Why not start with the 2x2x2x2? <p>The 2^4 is particularly confusing for beginners because half the puzzle turns at once so it's very easy to lose your bearings. While the 2^4 strategy is technically simpler, it's much much more challenging to wrap your head around, especially when you're new to 4D puzzles. Just like the 3^3 is a better starting puzzle in 3D, you learn lots of important concepts from the 3^4 that will help you with other puzzles.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#speedsolving","title":"Speedsolving","text":"What are the speedsolving records for 4D puzzles? <p>See the leaderboards.

If anyone wants to build a hypercubing leaderboard website, please do!</p>   I don't know full OLL/PLL/ZBLL/etc. Can I still get fast at 4D? <p>Absolutely! Most 4D speed methods are highly intuitive, and world-record times often use just 2-look OLL and PLL.</p>   Does full OLL/PLL/etc. exist for 4D puzzles? What about 4D algorithm explorers? <p>There's so many cases for each step of the solve that creating a complete algorithm set is basically impossible, and there's so many options for moves that algorithm explorers are infeasible. Almost every algorithm we have is based on an algorithm from 3D, and the only search program we have is a sort of optimizer for one very specific kind of algorithm derived from 3D.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#does-this-puzzle-exist","title":"Does this puzzle exist?","text":"4D Square-1 <p>Square-1 is fundamentally a bandaged dodecagonal prism.
